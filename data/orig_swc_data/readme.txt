This step is too time-consuming. Here we only selected a subset of neurons for demonstration. The data used in the paper has been processed and uploaded to data/neuron_path_data/zip_foldand can be used directly.
If you need to process your own raw SWC neuron data, we recommend that you create multiple folders under the unzipfolder to split the large amount of raw data in batches. Please pay attention to the path format. This ensures that data loss due to program crashes can be avoided. We will generate result files for each folder and then merge the result files into the unzipfolder.
